# Notes for Linkdoku

## Stuff about roles

- Roles should have a short-name
- Role short-names must be unique and must not be one of the reserved words
- Role short-names can be any capitalisation, but are normalised to lowercase for uniqueness checks

## Markdown stuff

- Role bios etc. are markdown
- We need a way to turn markdown into HTML on the client
- We need a way to edit markdown, with a preview tab or somesuch.
- We need to be able to resolve special names/links etc. on those tabs
